/**
 * opencode-auto-resume — adapted for OpenCode v2 plugin API.
 *
 * Port of https://github.com/Mte90/opencode-auto-resume (v1 hooks API) to the
 * v2 promise-plugin API (`Plugin.define` + `ctx.event.subscribe()`).
 *
 * What changed vs. v1:
 *  - Default export is `{ id, setup }` via `Plugin.define`; setup returns a cleanup fn.
 *  - Events come from `ctx.event.subscribe()` (AsyncIterable) with flat payloads
 *    (`{ type, data }`) instead of the v1 `event` hook (`{ type, properties }`).
 *  - SDK calls are flattened: `ctx.session.prompt({ sessionID, text })`,
 *    `ctx.session.interrupt({ sessionID })`, `ctx.session.active()`.
 *  - Assistant text is accumulated from `session.text.delta` events for liveness;
 *    `ctx.session.context()` (stable v2) supplies the authoritative final
 *    assistant text at idle time — replacing v1's `session.messages()` polling.
 *  - No `ctx.app.log` in v2: `ctx.app` is only `{name, version, channel}` (see
 *    `packages/plugin/src/app.ts`), and v2 has no `app.log` endpoint. Console
 *    output from a hosted plugin is not captured anywhere retrievable, so v1's
 *    `ctx.client.app.log(...)` has no equivalent. This build therefore appends
 *    to its own log file — see LOG_FILE below.
 *  - Targets the stable v2 API (`@opencode/plugin`). Event names are unchanged
 *    from the beta port; `session.execution.interrupted` now carries a `reason`.
 *
 * Detection/recovery features ported:
 *  - Stalled stream watchdog (busy session with no events for chunkTimeoutMs)
 *  - Execution/step failure recovery (`session.execution.failed`, `session.step.failed`)
 *  - Provider retry awareness (`session.retry.scheduled`)
 *  - Tool-call-printed-as-text detection + targeted recovery prompt
 *  - "Ready to continue" / stalled-intent ("...:") nudges
 *  - "Done" claim without work verification
 *  - Hallucination loop guard (too many auto-continues → interrupt + resume)
 *  - Subagent-awareness: does not recover a parent blocked on a running subagent
 *  - Permission-awareness: never recovers while a permission dialog is open
 *
 * Install: drop this file in ~/.config/opencode/plugins/ (auto-loaded), or add:
 *   { "plugins": [{ "package": "./plugins/auto-resume-v2.ts", "options": { ... } }] }
 */

/**
 * v2 entrypoint shape.
 *
 * The package depends on `@opencode-ai/plugin`, which exports `Plugin` only as a
 * *type* — `(input, options?) => Promise<Hooks>`. There is no runtime
 * `Plugin.define` in it, so the previous `import { Plugin } from
 * "@opencode/plugin"` did not resolve and the file could not be built or
 * type-checked at all (see the build script, which only ever built v1's
 * `src/index.ts`). The v2 contract is simply `{ id, setup }`, so define the
 * identity helper locally rather than importing a symbol that does not exist.

/**
 * The one live instance of this plugin in this PROCESS, shared across every
 * evaluation of this bundle.
 *
 * It lives on `globalThis`, not in module scope, and that is the whole fix. The
 * loader re-EVALUATES the plugin file on every config reload: the live log shows
 * one entrypoint URL, one pid, and a fresh module identity each time
 * (`mod=1812055.c6d4mu`, `.72a9tl`, `.dt27x7`, … six distinct copies inside one
 * server process). Module scope cannot help, because each copy gets its own
 * `activeInstance` — a singleton fix shipped that way and the storms continued
 * (19:54:19, eight identical `resume attempt 1/3` lines in 5ms).
 *
 * `globalThis` is shared by all module instances in a process (verified on both
 * node and bun), so a key here is the one channel that survives re-evaluation.
 * Each setup finds its predecessor through the registry and disposes it before
 * arming itself: last wins, so exactly one watchdog and one `resumeAttempts`
 * counter exist however often the loader reloads us. Disposal cannot be left to
 * the host, because the storms prove it does not always happen.
 *
 * Keyed by pid + plugin id: two servers in one process cannot happen, but two
 * config trees (v1 and v2) can load different builds, and they must not dispose
